Unfortunately some of his bullets missed the door and went through the classroom walls injuring one of the students! The shooter eventually gave up and walked away to find easier targets. The student is bleeding from the arm, but should be ok for a few hours. That was a very close call! Next time conceal your position better by turning off the lights.',
